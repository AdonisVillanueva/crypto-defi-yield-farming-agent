# crypto-defi-yield-farming-agent
A Python-based AI agent for analyzing DeFi and yield farming strategies, sharing community insights, and calculating risk scores, currently, utilizing the DeepSeek model with plans to incorporate other models like Claude and Chatgpt, depending on their strengths and weaknesses. For the most part, I'm just scraping data from the web for things like the Fear and Greed index as well as the AltCoin Season. For getting the price of crypto, I'm still using the free API from Coinmarketcap and Coingecko, however, if the app receives massive adoption I'll have to use the PRO or Paid tier (not cheap!). Hopefully, with more usage, the AI agent will become smart enough to not need some hand-holding (like I'm doing now). I have plans to add more features to the agent, especially the UI at: https://agentyield.streamlit.app/ - things like tracking your yield farm, and portfolio, and giving you suggestions to improve it (much harder to implement but not impossible!).

I will also have it integrate with Twitter and Telegram - like an AI bot where you send it a statement like "Give me a defi or yield farming strategy for {xyzCrypto}, and it will shoot you back a response just like it would in the app. Eventually, this will have to be monetized to continue running - accessing API especially if I start using the other AI models is going to cost a lot, I launched this AI agent and its token on base at virtuals: https://app.virtuals.io/virtuals/17471. Maybe, I'll take the token as a subscription payment from users to cover the ongoing costs of the AI and API subscription.

As for the AI Agent, it's supposed to create defi and yield farming strategies for the Bullish, Bearish, or Neutral market. So the idea is to somehow determine this Bullish, Bearish, and Neutral value from somewhere and I tried using AI to do it, however, it is NOT REAL-TIME, which means I have to come up with my calculation from real-time sources like the VIX, Fear and Greed Index and used this as the basis for how the AI agent would respond - and that is to "Give me a Bullish, Bearish, or Neutral defi and yield farming strategy for {xyzCrypto}! I've already trained it a strategy that I know to work (that I use and still use) and now it's consistently recommending it as one of the strategies to the user!
