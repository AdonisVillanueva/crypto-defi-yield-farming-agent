# crypto-defi-yield-farming-agent
A Python-based AI agent for analyzing DeFi and yield farming strategies, sharing community insights, and calculating risk scores. Currently, utilizing the DeepSeek model with plans to incorporate other models like Claude and Chatgpt, depending on their strengths and weaknesses. For the most part, I'm just scraping data from the web for things like the Fear and Greed index as well as the AltCoin Season. For getting the price of crypto, I'm still using the free API from Coinmarketcap and Coingecko, however, if the app receives massive adoption I'll have to use the PRO or Paid tier (not cheap!). Hopefully, with more usage, the AI agent will become smart enough to not need some hand holding (like I'm doing now). I have plans add more features to the agent, especially the UI at: https://agentyield.streamlit.app/ - things like tracking your yield farm, and portfolio, and giving you suggestions to improve it (much harder to implement but not impossible!).

I will also have it integrate with Twitter and Telegram - like an AI bot where you send it a statement like "Give me a defi or yield farming strategy for {xyzCrypto}, and it will shoot you back a response just like it would in the app.
